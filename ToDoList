BUGS
- ProjectView Scrollview - when dragged past first/last project there is a jerk as it snaps back to one cell being central
- ProjectView Popover - update the screen following the popover so that text and colours are updated
- TasksView - duration text jiggles around when changing time length

FIXED BUGS
- FIXED - Problem was caused nby not refreshing data before presenting collectionview - ProjectView ScrollView - scrolling in more than one direction, not updating the collection view when adding projects. Followed a fresh delete / install on the simulator (reproduceable)
